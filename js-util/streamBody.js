/**
 * An asynchronous function for streaming the body of a Response object
 * obtained from a fetch() request. Pass the Response object as the first
 * argument followed by two optional callbacks.
 *
 * If you specify a function as the second argument, that reportProgress
 * callback will be called once for each chunk that is received. The first
 * argument passed is the total number of bytes received so far. The second
 * argument is a number between 0 and 1 specifying how complete the download
 * is. If the Response object has no "Content-Length" header, however, then
 * this second argument will always be NaN.
 *
 * If you want to process the data in chunks as they arrive, specify a
 * function as the third argument. The chunks will be passed, as Uint8Array
 * objects, to this processChunk callback.
 *
 * streamBody() returns a Promise that resolves to a string. If a processChunk
 * callback was supplied then this string is the concatenation of the values
 * returned by that callback. Otherwise the string is the concatenation of
 * the chunk values converted to UTF-8 strings.
